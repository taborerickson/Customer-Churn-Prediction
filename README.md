# Customer-Churn-Prediction
End-to-end project pipeline for customer churn predictions including data ingestion (Telco Customer Churn dataset), data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, model development and tuning, evaluation, interpretation, and visualizations



1.) Project Title + Elevator pitch 
2.) Data Source + Link 
3.) Quick setup + How to run (Demo?) 
4.) Main Results (ROC AUC, best model, important features) 
5.) Key business recommendations (2-4) 
6.) Files in repo and how to use saved model 


Built end-to-end customer churn prediction pipeline using Telco dataset â€” performed feature engineering, handled class imbalance (SMOTE & class weights), tuned XGBoost model (ROC AUC 0.86), and produced SHAP explainability with actionable retention recommendations.
